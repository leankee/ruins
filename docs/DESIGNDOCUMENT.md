# Main idea
The first part of Portal 2 shows us how Aperture Science has recovered after years of abandonment. “Ruins” is the complete opposite. This map series will show how  Aperture Science gradually collapsed to the state in which we see it in the first act of the game.
# Synopsis
You assume the role of one of the test subjects who survived after the Relaxation Center shutdown. Your goal is to escape from the Enrichment Center, and to achieve it you will have to go through a testing track that leads to the surface. As we go through it we see the gradual destruction of Aperture Science after the death of GLaDOS.
# Content
"Ruins" is split into 3 chapters. Each chapter has 3 maps in it. Each chapter will start and end with a bts section
## Chapter 1
### Map 1
We wake up from suspension, right before it shuts down. Wheatley enters and tells us to follow him. He leads us to the elevator to the surface, but on the way there the walkway breaks and we fall to the very bottom. We find ourselves in offices, from where we get into our first test chamber.

# Gameplay
“Ruins” will have 21 tests, 7 for each chapter. 2 in the first map, 3 in the second, and 2 in the last one. In each chapter a new testing element will be introduced.
# Visuals
Our visuals correlate with our main idea. In the original game, the restoration of Aperture Science was shown through a gradual change in style: from Overgrown to Reconstruction and from Reconstruction to Clean style. We want to do the same but in reverse. “Ruins” will have 3 overgrown-based styles, 1 for each chapter. They will change from map to map and blend into each other like in the first acts of Portal 2.
## Style 1
Serves as a “pre-overgrown” style. Mostly clean chambers in damaged state due to the tremors and explosions that started to happen after the death of GLaDOS.
### Map 1
Here test chambers are the least damaged since they are far from the GLaDOS chamber. However, test chambers are not in a good state, there are still some cracks and holes here and there.
### Map 2
Rising higher, we become closer to the GLaDOS chamber, which causes more destruction to appear. Cracks and holes become larger and they appear more often.
### Map 3
The level of destruction reaches its peak. Holes are everywhere now.

## Style 2
The main purpose of this style is to show how rust has spread throughout the complex. As we got closer to the surface, moisture appeared in the test chambers, which is why they began to rust.
### Map 1
There is not much rust in these chambers, since moisture reached them last. So far it is only in the corners and around holes, as well as in the form of small spots.
### Map 2
Here the rust had time to spread much more strongly. Now entire rooms are covered with it, but some places still remain clean.
### Map 3
Chambers become completely covered with rust.

## Style 3
This style shows how the test chambers have gradually become overgrown. We are very to the surface, from where plants began to penetrate into the complex.
### Map 1
High humidity and proximity to the surface led to the appearance of moss in the chambers.
### Map 2
Some plant seeds entered the test chambers, where they began to grow due to the favorable environment.
### Map 3
The plants got into these chambers earlier, so they had more time to grow. Because of this, test chambers are completely overgrown.
