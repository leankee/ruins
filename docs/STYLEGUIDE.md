# Style Guide
This document describes the style of this mappack. The main idea of the style is to show the gradual destruction of Aperture Science. The further we go, the more destruction we can see. The style is divided into 3 parts. Each part has 3 maps in it.

## Part 1: Ð¡racks
After the death of Glados, the laboratory began to collapse. This cause holes and cracks to appear in test chambers.
