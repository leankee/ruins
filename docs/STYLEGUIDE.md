# Style Guide
This document describes the style of this mappack. The first part of Portal 2 shows us how the aperture has recovered after years of abandonment. Ruins are the complete opposite. This mappack will show how the aperture gradually collapsed to the state in which we see it in the main game.

## Stage 1: Ð¡racks
After the death of Glados, the laboratory began to collapse. This cause holes and cracks to appear in test chambers.

### Map 3
Cracks reach their final size. From now on, the level of destruction in all subsequent maps should be the same.

## Stage 2: Rust
The closer we get to the surface, the more moisture gets into the chambers, which leads to the appearance of rust.
